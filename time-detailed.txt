big file: 2 hours
symbolic links: 1.5 hours

timeout for bigfile yet:(

As i was running it on qemugdb -> docker container -> real hardware,
it was no doubt to be slow.

Below was the result without time limits:
```bash
make[1]: Leaving directory '/s081'
== Test running bigfile == 
$ make qemu-gdb
running bigfile: OK (533.7s) 
    (Old xv6.out.bigfile failure log removed)
== Test running symlinktest == 
$ make qemu-gdb
(1.9s) 
== Test   symlinktest: symlinks == 
  symlinktest: symlinks: OK 
== Test   symlinktest: concurrent symlinks == 
  symlinktest: concurrent symlinks: OK 
== Test usertests == 
$ make qemu-gdb
usertests: OK (590.0s) 
== Test time == 
time: OK 
Score: 100/100
```
