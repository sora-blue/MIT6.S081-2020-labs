DNS test result looks greatly 
depends on network environment.

In our campus network it was always 52 bits
processed but 511 bits received. I switched
to 4G mobile network, and i passed!

Finally... (cry & laugh)

19:30 - 21:30 initial implementation
21:30 - 23:00 debug until others in lab have left
    stopped on multi process, it just stuck here
    while i could not debug out the exact loop
    i thought it was because lock
23:00 - 24:00 reflect on life
    It came me that only 4 packets were received
    so some packets were definitely lost
    nothing to do with the lock
    I thought of two possibilities:
        1. the packets flow too fast to overflow some packetss
        2. i lost packets while reading packets
    That was the time when i came back to the lab reference doc
    and found: 
    ```
        Your e1000_recv() code must scan the RX ring and
        deliver **each** new packet's mbuf to the network stack (in net.c) by calling net_rx().
    ```
    I was too excited, so i jumped down my bed to start coding.
24:00 - 25:00 fix the mistake
    Solved multiple
    Got stuck on "52 bits processed but 511 received"
25:00 - 25:57 try and try
    still i thought it had sth to do with the lock
    so i came out with 3 differenent solutions
    (see e1000.c.bak)
    all "511 received"
    
    i looked packets.pcap dumped content
    it actually contains some useful info
    like nameserver

    so i guess it was a network error
    I switched 3 differenent net environment
    Finally made it full grade on mobile phone network

Now i've finished all 6.s081 labs with my own
hands (plus detailed hints). Cheers!
