Q:
Why are there missing keys with 2 threads,
but not with 1 thread? Identify a sequence of events with 2 threads 
that can lead to a key being missing.
Submit your sequence with a short explanation in answers-thread.txt 

A:
Say thread 0 puts a value into the hash table, while
thread 1 also puts one into the hash table. And their
buckets happen to the same bucket. So there's a race
during the execution of insert(). They may read the argument
struct entry **p that is the same value, and insert an entry,
when the earlier entry gets lost.
